# ue4_AdditionalActorActions
This plugin allows one to convert selected actors and their components as blueprint actor.
1) Blueprint actors with custom logic will be added to new blueprint actor as child actor components
2) Components of blueprint actors without custom logic will be added as usual. Actor itself won't be added as child actor component.
